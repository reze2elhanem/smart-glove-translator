# Smart Glove Translator

## Overview
The Smart Glove Translator is a wearable device that converts hand gestures into text using **flex sensors** and an **MPU6050 motion sensor**. Each finger has a flex sensor that detects its bending angle, while the MPU6050 measures the rotation of the hand. The data is processed by an **Arduino**, and the recognized gestures are displayed on an **LCD screen**.

## Goal
To create an assistive device that helps people with speech or hearing disabilities communicate easily using gestures.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- 10 Flex Sensors (one for each finger)
-  2 MPU6050 Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Jumper Wires
- Power Source (battery or USB)

## How It Works
1. Each flex sensor measures how much each finger is bent.
2. The MPU6050 reads the handâ€™s motion and rotation.
3. The Arduino processes the readings and compares them to pre-defined gesture values.
4. The detected gesture is shown on the LCD screen.
5. Later versions will include a voice module to speak the translated words.

## Future Plans
- Add a voice output module
- Create a 3D printed glove design
- Train a machine learning model for dynamic gestures
