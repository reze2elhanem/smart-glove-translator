## 10/18/2025 - Brainstormed, designed  prototype, and refined project idea  

Today, I spent![ Image 18 أكتوبر 2025، 02_29_12 م.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzA4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9860dae6e8a1b2700b77f9d282a461c6378be015/ChatGPT%20Image%2018%20%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%B1%202025%D8%8C%2002_29_12%20%D9%85.png)

 hours brainstorming and shaping my project idea, Sign2Speech. At first, I struggled to figure out how to actually turn sign language into speech  it felt like a huge technical challenge. I started researching each sensor one by one to understand how they work and how they could fit into my idea.

At first, I tried using AI to design a 3D prototype so I could visualize my concept better, but honestly, the results weren’t exactly what I had in mind  it helped me imagine things more clearly though. After more searching and testing different possibilities, I realized that using Flex Sensors and the MPU6050 together would give the most accurate and smooth results.

It was a mix of frustration and excitement, but by the end of the day, I finally managed to put the concept together in a clear way and start writing my project description. I feel like the idea is becoming more real step by step.
